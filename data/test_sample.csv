**Random vaccine stats**


* Based on this week's vaccination rates, **75% of 12+** Ontarians will have received **both** doses by **August 21, 2021 at 14:18** - 6 days to go 
* Another projection assumes that second doses will follow the pace of the 1st doses, and therefore will slow down as we approach the 75% number. We crossed today's second dose percentage in first doses on *June 17, 2021*, and the 75% first dose threshold on *June 24, 2021*, **7 days** later. In this projection, we will reach the 75% second dose threshold on **August 22, 2021 at 12:50**

34,Tech,linux_gaming,Counter-Strike Global Offensive is currently broken on Linux,"The popular game by Valve which natively supports Linux is currently unplayable due to multiple issues with Valves' anti-cheat measures.

Edit: The second one of the following issues (#2734) has supposedly been resolved. The first one (#2630) still stands.

Edit 2: Both Issues have been fixed. See the related Github Issues.

The function ""Trust-Factor"" which assigns a reputation to players and groups them with similarly rated players was significantly degraded for Linux players since rougly January 2021, resulting in Linux players being queued predominantly with cheaters (who actually deserve a low Trust-Factor).
It is being speculated, that this might have something to do with recent Mesa driver updates, or having ""resizable BAR"" enabled in BIOS, since playing with an account that previously had a high ""Trust-Factor"" on an affected Linux machine just once, significantly degrades the ""Trust-Factor"" of that account after just one day (shown by a red warning to friends that queue with the account). This issue is being tracked here: [#2630](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/2630)

As of yesterday, when starting a session in the game, Linux and Mac users were furthermore being warned, that [CS:GO was not able to launch in ""Trusted Mode"", despite the console log showing that it is enabled](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63616666/117991762-04d43c80-b347-11eb-8f2e-72a146c8c45e.png). This has immediately the same effect as playing with a low ""Trust-Factor"".  This issue is being tracked here: [#2734](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/2734) and has since been resolved. The other issue sadly still stands.

Just as an example the price of 1 Bitcoin went from 255,000 Liras to almost 800,000 in just 5 months. That's a 200%+ profit in just 6 months. Compare that to USD gains and you'll notice the difference. And it's still going up as I write this post. The best part is that you will always be in green because we know 100% - Erdogan is gonna keep f\*\*\*ing things up!

Bonus point: Your coins will reach a new ATH almost every day.

For some reason, Apple Maps wouldn't show the subway station. So I asked a person and was able to find it. 

When I arrived at my destination, I used Apple Maps to find a restaurant to go for lunch. I can see a TGI Friday's is nearby, so I follow the map to get there. Nope, doesn't exist. 

So I find another restaurant (Cali-Mex), and follow Apple Maps to get there. Nope, doesn't exist either.

I'm now lost and want to make my way back to the subway station. But of course, Apple Maps won't show the subway station.

So what is the point of this app? It is not useful.

I've since installed Google Maps and it (a) shows all subway stations and (b) doesn't show these non-existent restaurants.

82,Covid related,COVID19positive,"29/M, got it at movie theatre most likely","Double vaxxed with Moderna. 

Went to watch Matrix on Boxing Day in theatres, woke up the next day feeling like garbage. Confirmed using an official at home test. 

Symptoms:
- sluggish
- felt very weak
- extremely chilly (purple fingernails)
- night sweats
- fever
- a little more difficult to breathe
- significant muscle pain
- some foods tasted weird (in a bad way)
- very uncoordinated

It’s been about 5 days since then. I’m still on the weak side but am slowly getting better. 

I’ll say even though I’m relatively “young”, this virus was no joke. If I hadn’t have been double vac’d, I shudder to think how much worse it could have been. I’m grateful looking back. 

My tips for getting better are:
- rest
- water
- warm baths and showers
- eat as healthy as possible
- use tylenol/ibuprofen if the pain and fever gets unbearable (I had to)
- use good supplements if necessary

125,Highest raw growth in the last year,CryptoCurrency,[Emergency Proposal] Remove users from moon distribution due to bypassing karma limits,"

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It has recently come to the moderators attention that two of the top users this month have been operating multiple accounts in order to bypass the karma limits on this subreddit. These users are:

u/WackyMister

u/Imaginary-Cow25

I won't share many details on how this has been identified but the moderation team and myself have *no doubts* this is the same user, using multiple accounts to bypass the 15k karma limit. As you can see below, those two users (or shall I say this user) have a lot of similarities in writing style

[https://imgur.com/a/8wgniqW](https://imgur.com/a/8wgniqW)

[https://imgur.com/a/2qQNna3](https://imgur.com/a/2qQNna3)

These are not the only evidence there is, moderators have **many other evidences** that won't be disclosed on here for obvious reasons.

Keep in mind, these users are not banned just for having a very similar writing style. The examples cited above are just a ***tiny sample***. Writing style is not the only thing moderators look for, but it's the most visual thing to share to everyone on here.

While this user may have been permanently banned from this subreddit, we still need an emergency proposal to remove this user from distribution or **20158 karma or 5422 moons** will still be distributed to this user on October 6th.

This subreddit have very strict rules on using multiple accounts to bypass the karma cap, or otherwise game the system in an effort to earn more moons. Rule 3 is ""No Manipulation"" and that counts for bypassing Governance rules for the subreddit.

By passing this poll, it will remove the above accounts from the current distribution, ensuring they do not receive the final moons allocated for their posts and comments in snapshot 18. The methodology to address problem users has been laid out by Reddit admins.

127,Tech,linux,What's something that could/should have a GUI but doesn't?,"I'm against desktop users >having< to use the command line to accomplish something, it should be completely optional. Even if the command line is faster, the GUI will always be more intuitive because you don't have to memorize it first, you can simply figure out a way of doing what you need by interacting with it. Anyway, that's not what I want to discuss, what I want to know is:

What's something that you think could/should have a GUI on Linux/your DE but doesn't? Also say what's your current desktop environment in case you think it's relevant to what you're talking about.

Some I can remember from the top of my head:

DE: I'm on KDE Plasma

- Game controllers (Xbox, Playstation, Generic) should have a GUI for remapping and changing driver options

- Graphical utility for installing and managing options for all device drivers and codecs (While some distros may ship something similar, Plasma itself doesn't).

- GUI for changing time from UTC to local time for dual-boot situations (to be fair Windows doesn't have a GUI for that either).

- GUI for importing fonts from a Windows partition or to install Microsoft fonts (some distros might have a MS fonts package but usually it's not listed on programs like Discover or Gnome Software). This is something that was really handy back in the Mandrake/Mandriva days.

- GUI for quickly formating external devices like flash drives without the need to download an advanced tool like Gparted.

- Flatpak permissions should be manageable from Discover, without the need to download any other tool. (This apparently will be a project on 2022's Season of KDE). Alternatively, it would be even better to be asked for each program when something needs permission (microphone, camera, folders) like mobile OS' do. Portals can do that but they're not available for all permissions.

- GUI for changing graphic driver settings (VRR, HDR, Color Management, custom graphical presets for specific applications, etc) and seeing performance stats of the current application.",None,2021-12-24 12:54:41,0,58,0.87,rnuoev,Undetected

The Playlist in case anyone wants to check it out (I will keep uploading videos daily - just won't post it here - so feel free to suggest games for benchmarking) is [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYB8ooZG4ATmtA1Em_gTLWptW6kvV5Jlg).

Again, I'm really sorry for this and I hope someone at least got a better idea of what gaming on Linux is like because of these videos. Cheers! :)

Just saw this news today that 8.5 million was scammed out of 400+people in the down of 2 weeks. In a single country. Imagine how much more is being scammed in the other 190+ countries out there. Some scams are at a national level.

There's a statement in the article that stood out for me  -

> ""Once the funds have been fraudulently transferred out of the victim's bank account, it would be challenging and difficult to recover the stolen monies,""

Oh, so the issue is the same with crypto, isn't it?

The argument against crypto is just high flying banking industry rich folk speaking through politicians mouths.

Pasring part of the article below:

>SINGAPORE - Since the start of December, at least 469 people have fallen prey to phishing scams involving OCBC Bank, with reported losses totalling at least $8.5 million.

>Most of the amount was lost over the past two weeks, said the police in a media release on Thursday evening (Dec 30).

>Over the Christmas weekend alone, OCBC said 186 customers lost about $2.7 million.

>Victims received unsolicited SMSes purporting to be from the bank, claiming there were issues with their banking accounts and they had to click on a link given in the message to resolve the issue.

>The link led to fake bank websites and victims were asked to key in their Internet banking account login details.

>""Once the funds have been fraudulently transferred out of the victim's bank account, it would be challenging and difficult to recover the stolen monies,"" said the police.

She tested positive on New Years eve and believes it's from being exposed to a coworker who tested positive. I tested negative on Thursday. On Tuesday I woke up with a tickle in my throat, a slight cough, and a runny nose. I decided to try an at home test and sure enough I was positive. I also am awaiting PCR test results but I'm expecting a positive test from that also.

I am vaccinated with booster. The worst symptoms I experienced were yesterday when my cough got kind of bad and I had a stuffy nose. Today I am feeling pretty normal with some leftover congestion. I've made the decision to not go to my sister's wedding because Saturday would technically be the 5th day since I started showing symptoms. I imagine as of now I am still testing positive and probably will be on Saturday. 

I get that I'm doing the correct thing by not going, but I also feel terrible that I'm missing out on her big day when I don't even really feel sick. I guess I'm just posting this for confirmation bias.

The two sides fought until they were 'exhausted' which took 7 years (shocker...). No one gained or lost any land. The cause of the war was that both Sweden and Denmark got new kings in 1559 and 1560 and they wanted to mark their territory.

190,Highest raw growth in the last year,CryptoCurrency,47.9% of people believe that cryptocurrencies are not a safe investment,"Overall, nearly half (47.9%) of people believe that cryptocurrencies are not a safe investment, and a further 37.1% are unsure about the safety of investing in cryptos.   

Just 13.8% of people regard cryptocurrencies as a safe investment product.

When the data is split by age, it’s clear that it’s mainly young adults who feel that cryptos are a safe investment. Almost a third (27.5%) of those aged between 18 and 34 feel their money is safe when investing in cryptocurrencies, and this figure drops significantly within the older age groups.  

Just 9.7% of adults aged 35 and over view cryptocurrencies as a safe investment, and the figure drops substantially to just 2.9%  when we look at those aged 45 and above.

**People’s attitudes towards the safety of cryptos as an investment, by age**

The original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, originated in 2009, making the whole concept of online currency a relatively recent invention. Given that it’s only been around for a decade it’s not surprising that younger people are more at ease with the concept as they have grown up with it. However for older generations there is significantly less trust in something that they still regard as a new development.

&#x200B;

**Cryptocurrencies form a part of wider investment strategies**

As cryptocurrencies become more and more mainstream, many people are starting to include cryptos as part of their wider investment strategies.  

Out of those who have invested in cryptocurrencies, a large percentage (85.7%) also have other investments and savings.

This trend is the same across every age group, however, the percentage of people who only have cryptocurrencies, and no other investments, does increase slightly with age.

&#x200B;

**Percentage of those who do not have any investments other than cryptocurrencies, by age**

**Only half of crypto investors are getting financial advice**

Although cryptocurrencies are volatile and can see people lose their whole investment in a short space of time, only half (56.1%) of investors received professional financial advice before buying cryptos.

But, what’s surprising is that it’s actually the younger age groups who are more likely to take the additional step of getting advice before investing.

Over two thirds (65%) of 18-24 year olds got financial advice before making their investment, and this percentage decreases gradually with age.

Words (insert eg x% )that was used years ago as the go to for panic posts- 

Since we are seeing a bit of volatility today and I’m starting to see panic posts some words from veterans here from years ago to keep the chin up and HODL strong. 

The market tend to have a bullwhip effect vs normal stock market nowadays so any move is exponentially larger. Part of the risk and excitement of being in the crypt. If you haven’t been here long (most people here have got into the crypt the last 4 months) this is part of the game and likely will be for a time. This is good as this also gives the gainz over time more than traditional markets. 

The market is more mature than years gone by but the volatility is still there albeit less pronounced eg 80% drop in 2hrs - keep it simple (dont over trade)and HODL in what you believe in and may the gwei be with you….

PS this is something that has been part of crypto since the early days that hardens one to a new level of apathy and diamond hands the real test comes in when suicide lines come in at the post 30% drops to 80% drops.

Hey,

We're a bunch of devs working on Dead Cells, winner of Action Game of the Year 2018 at the Game Awards. If you don't know what the game is like, here's our [original gameplay trailer on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X56EtuqXfek).

We all work at Evil Empire, a small indie studio that's been providing ongoing support & free updates to Dead Cells for 4 years while the original creators 'Motion Twin' are working on a new project (there's a couple of ex-Motion Twinners at Evil Empire and we share the same office, so we're all mixed in together!).We've just come off the release of The Queen and the Sea DLC, which brings a whole new ending, mechanics and levels to the game, and there's a pretty cool [animated trailer for that on YouTube too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezDxvFUxDvc)!

In the junk bond chapter he spends time excoriating the entire concept of using EBITDA to value companies and their cash flows because of the serious flaws with using the metric. This is not the first time I've read about how EBITDA is essentially a BS metric - I know I've read articles about how Buffett and Munger both detest the metric as well. If EBITDA is so fundamentally flawed, then why do B-schools still teach it and why do we still use it for valuing companies? I mean according to Klarman it helped contribute to the junk bond debacle, and it has been pointed out for years by other experts about EBITDA can often vastly over exaggerate a company's financial position/health.

211,Highest raw growth in the last year,stocks,Averaging down is dangerous with the wrong stock. Catching the falling knife.,"Do to recent events there has been a large influx of new investors and traders. All these new people is a good thing for the market. More people= more money in the market which is good for all of us. But due to this new growth of investors a lot of the new people don’t understand certain strategies and are being misled by other selfish investors into making huge mistakes.

Bringing your cost basis down is a strategy that a lot of investors use when they buy into a stock that sells off after. Generally you will see this when someone makes a large purchase leading up to an earnings report or some news event and things don’t pan out. The stock sells off 10% and they buy the dip to bring their cost basis down. This only works when the company you’re investing in is strong financially and fundamentally and when the macro conditions are conducive for a bull market.

Why doesn’t this apply to the lot of meme stocks that exploded last month? Because their value was never based on anything financial or fundamental. What I am seeing now is people lowering their cost basis based on cosmetic appearance alone. $300 costs basis looks much worse than $100 costs basis when the stock is trading at $50 right ??? Wrong! it really comes down to how many shares you own for example:
Investor A buys 1 share of GME at $300 and the stock is currently trading at $50 their costs basis is $300 and they’re down $250. Investor B purchased 1 share at $300 and then 10 shares at $200 and another 10 shares at $100. Their cost basis is $157 but since they own 21 shares and the share price is $50 they’re down $2,247. 

Investor B has a much lower cost basis ($157) than investor A  ($300) but is down a lot more money ($2247 vs $300) When you chase after a parabolic stock that is not tied to fundamentals or finances and it eventually crashes you’re not supposed to buy the dip. This is called trying to catch a falling knife. Buying the dip is a fundamentals play, it’s a belief in the companies long term prospects and finances. What happened last month was the opposite of fundamentals.

TLDR lowering your costs basis “averaging down”
Is dangerous with the wrong stock. It is a fundamentals play and cannot be applied to the non-fundamental moves in meme stocks last month. Don’t try and catch the falling knife.",None,2021-02-17 7:43:57,0,511,0.91,llxb6m,Undetected

216,Highest raw growth in the last year,stocks,"If someone finishes their DD with ‘this could be the next GME’, I am instantly put off.","This meme stock explosion has made me even more tight and Scrooge-like with my money. I have most of money sitting in blue chip stocks like DIS & HSBC amongst many others with a small amount for playing, doing my own DD on and hoping for a 3x but settling for a small profit or loss in most cases. 

I love reading other people’s DD, always have, and it’s great to have a community that helps you cut down a bit of the work (even though you must follow up with your own reading) in potentially spotting something that could be big. However, there has been a massive spike recently of people that finish they DD with ‘this could be the next GME’ or something similar and as soon as I read that, I am instantly put off. 

Everything they have said up to that point gets a little tainted for me. 

I know this is completely irrational and actually a bit stupid on my part but I equate it to a restaurant that has ‘The Best (insert food item)‘ or ‘World Famous blah blah’ on their menu. It puts me off instantly.

I don't think that the CPU is the bottleneck because it isn't fully loaded either, and i get high UPS (Which is CPU dependent), but low FPS in Factorio. I ran glmark2 and there the GPU was fully loaded and i got 11963 score. I also tried to use the 470 driver instead of 495 but nothing changed. If i don't find a solution to this problem on my current distro (Manjaro), should i try any other distros?

If you don't know what the issue is, could you please suggest other places where i can ask for help

**All games have been claimed (sorry!). Thanks for your kind replies everyone. Hope I was able to make someones day a bit better. Cheers!**

**----------------**

Hey everyone, I hope you guys had a great Christmas eve and got some nice presents :) I wanted to give back some love to the Linux community and thought I could give away spare game keys I collected and filtered though over time from Humble Bundle or similar platforms.

There recently was a similar thread on here by u/ZorgonPeterson ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/rfgwii/enjoy_these_games_please/)) that I liked so same terms apply:

>Terms  
>  
>**Post a comment (do not DM)** requesting the key you want and I will DM you the steam key assuming it's available. I'll reply to your comment to let you know when the key is sent or if it's no longer available. None of these keys should be claimed, but if they are I apologize ahead of time.  
>  
>\- First come, first serve  
>  
>\- Please do NOT claim more than one key per person  
>  
>\- \[Optional\] Let everyone know what you plan to do with your new game :)

Also no newly created accounts.

I want to apologies up front if any of those keys don't work (should though). It's also possible that some of the games won't work on Linux or are not well supported like VR titles, so please keep that in mind.

So, here is the list:

You can read my DD about Auto Loan Asset Backed Securities (ALABS) here (https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/rqle93/the_big_short_again_auto_loans_bubble_edition/). 

Holy shit. This could be the missing piece to the puzzle. The subprime mortgage backed securities of 2021. Here we go. (This is my first DD: please excuse any cohesive or organizational errors.)

*Note: I was inspired by* [*this post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/romtv4/this_is_even_larger_than_the_big_short/) *and* [*this post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qlipam/yesterday_weve_had_notice_of_a_cmbs_downgrade/)*. Please check them out.*

The theory: Student Loan Asset Backed Securities (SLABs) have become the new collateral in place of subprime mortgage backed securities. And this situation may be even worse. Here's why.

After mortgage backed securities shit the bed in 2008, funds needed another form of collateral to support their dogshit wrapped in catshit. Enter SLABs. They're exactly what they sound like: securities based on outstanding student loans. These loans are then packaged into tranches and sold to investors (Sound familiar?). However, I am of the opinion that these SLABs are drastically overvalued (Sound familiar part 2?), and this has been compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Student loans, by US law, are very difficult to discharge. (And yes, private SLABs that don't adhere to federal law exist, but federal loans make up 90% of all student loans). By law, you have to prove in a court that the loan will cause you an 'undue hardship on you and your dependents' if you wish to discharge it completely. This is very vague, and I am under the impression that most judges will not even consider these cases as it was your choice to take out the loan in the first place: you knew the risks when you decided to go to that 80k out of state school and get a philosophy degree. Proving something ambiguous like this beyond reasonable doubt is not easy. Even defaulting doesn't help - a portion of your income will be taken until the loan is repaid. What is the effect of this? Well, these SLABs became very, very strong collateral. And until now, they were. But we'll get to that in a minute.

These loans were so strong that you have probably noticed their effects without realizing it. Just look at how high college tuitions have risen since 2008. In fact, compared to '08, tuition has increased a whopping *54.4%* according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

https://imgur.com/PzyNQSt

And just look at the average student loan balance per borrower since '08. Nearly *double.*

https://imgur.com/z13ZPYa

It makes sense why these values have shot up: because these SLABs are difficult to discharge and are thus very robust, they are valuable and companies want *as many loans taken out as possible.* Therefore, increasing college tuitions drastically to cause more loans to be taken out was a logical step. This was all working fine until one year changed everything.

Enter, 2019. The pandemic completely bends the economy over. Well, one of the ways that politicians decided to stimulate the economy and stave off the effects of a crash was to start implementing student loan forgiveness. Sounds great, right? Well, not for the people using these loans as collateral. These policies immediately caused a decrease in the value of these SLABs as collateral, as there was unsurety of payment. And what happened again recently? Yup, student loans postponed again. And we all know what happens when the underlying securities lose value. This should be sounding familiar. These funds will start trying to offload these SLABs while they still have some value, and the bubble begins to burst.

Now, let's get even more technical. Let's talk about income-based repayment plans (aka Pay As You Earn, or PAYE). The graph below should explain further. [***The pdf from which I got it is linked here: it is very enlightening, and it goes into much more depth on this topic. I would HIGHLY recommend you check it out.*** ](https://www.hvst.com/attachments/2767?download=true)

https://imgur.com/a/3biEsRH

Woah, what does this mean? I'll try to simplify the best I can. The IBR stands for *Income Based Repayment.* This is just another way to say a PAYE payment plan. You can see these increase exponentially after '08. This may seem like a good thing, as paying percentages of loans based on income does in fact decrease the chances of a default, as you are not 'biting off more than you can chew'. However, this had severe unintended consequences.  Now, loans take much longer to pay off: in fact, it is highly likely that these loans will not be repaid until well after the final maturation date of the original loan. Essentially, this is another contributing factor to the decreasing value of using these SLABs as collateral.

Some other quotes from this PDF that I found notable.

*""The deleterious credit underwriting standards during this time \[2003-2008\] was not exclusive to the subprime mortgage market. In hindsight, we are seeing that credit scores did little to forecast repayment""*. Here, they basically say that the same thing with faulty ratings was happening to SLABs as was happening to subprime mortgages. I believe this practice has continued into 2021, as we haven't seen SLABs have the same drastic loss of value as subprime mortgages (yet...).

*""If a downgrade were to occur, the funds owning these notes would likely be inclined to sell as their fund must hold AAA-rated debt.""* Holy shit doesn't this sound familiar? Ratings agencies have incentive to rate these tranches AAA if they are going to sell at all. Well, like I mentioned before, these SLABs are about to eat it, and they maybe already have. It's literally 2008 all over again, corrupt ratings and all.

But why did I say it may be even worse? Well, with the housing crisis in 2008, there was still some sort of physical collateral to offset potential losses. *Repos*. Well, even though most of you guys snort crayons all day, I'm sure you're smart enough to realize that you can't repo a gender studies degree. There simply is no physical collateral. Because of this, funds do NOT want to get stuck bagholding, because they can't screw over the people who took out the loan in the first place to get some of their money back. This will make the bubble absolutely implode on itself.

In my mind, this relates to GME because as soon as funds start fighting each other and going bankrupt, short positions will inevitably have to close.

Obviously, this theory is just that: a theory. Again, this is my first ever DD, so I apologize for any missed information. Hopefully even wrinklier brains can take over my train of thought and really crack this thing open. Or, you guys could prove me wrong and it could be a total nothingburger. Either way, I'd appreciate some community crowdsourcing to really get to the bottom of whether funds have been doing this and whether it poses a significant risk to the economy. I believe this collateral market specifically is worth looking into because of the sheer amount of money involved. $1.6 trillion total in student loans in the USA. 

Edit: for some reason my pictures got messed up. Maybe someone can tell me how to fix? Don’t really want to repost. Tried editing them in again on PC to no avail. Gonna try to embed imgur next.

Edit2: I’ve been getting lots of great comments about the legal aspect, and how beyond reasonable doubt is only with criminal trials. However, the thesis remains unchanged in my opinion. It’s still VERY difficult to discharge these loans, as you still have to show ‘undue’ harm. It’s hard to argue something is ‘undue’ when you could’ve gone to a cheaper school, could’ve tried to get a higher paying degree, could’ve got a second job, etc.

Edit3: Holy shit. I’m already getting some more great info from comments. Expect a part 2 soon.",None,2021-12-25 23:39:18,0,9224,0.97,ros6ii,Undetected

10:28 one of tinies:
As many of you are aware an attack occurred on Tinyman Pools on January 1st/2nd.
The attack exploits a previously unknown bug in the contract and allows the attacker to withdraw assets from a pool that they are not entitled to. The attack has been executed on multiple pools until now. The financial incentive for the attack varies from pool to pool so not all pools have been attacked.

>(
As a trustless protocol Tinyman uses immutable contracts. This unfortunately means there is no ability for a quick fix to this problem for the current pools. We will work on a fix for the problem and deploy a new version of the contracts and put a migration plan in place. 
>(
In the meantime we believe the best plan of action is to ask our community to remove all their liquidity from ALL Tinyman pools. 
>(
We will make sure that the community is taken care of and we will publish a detailed incident report in the coming days.

316,Political,PoliticalDiscussion,What do you think about legislating our way through demographic changes?,"Hi all,

I'm more of a classic republican/conservative. I tend to prefer small government solutions but I'm not up in arms over many social issues (more live and let live, but not in the libertarian sense of elimination of driver's licenses). However, this one befuddled me as Romney put up a measure to compensate adults for having children, up to a point.

We have really cut back on immigration over the past decade, starting with Obama and escalating with Trump. Some economics, some policy. Immigrants have more kids but by second generation the birth rate is right back to where their peers are at.

At the same time, we have joined the other rich countries with a birth rate falling below replacement. That means we stop growing and our elderly will surpass our youth. Things like social security taxes rely on the youth paying in. We won't see the real consequences for a few decades but it's one of those issues that needs to be solved ahead of the consequences. That is, if we think the consequences are negative.

So what does everyone think?

Do we reverse immigration policies?

Do we pay people to have kids?

Do we change/add other family policies?

Do we do something else?

Do we do nothing and embrace a lower growth society?

Something else?",None,2021-02-05 6:09:33,0,15,0.89,ld7vji,Undetected

319,Covid related,COVID19positive,Delta bites.,"In the first week of august, My brother (22), his wife (20), and their one year old baby were at their friends house multiple times that weekend. Turns out they were exposed to covid. None of them were vaccinated. They came home and a few days later I (25, fully vaccinated) started coughing and feeling cold like symptoms. 8/7/21 I took a covid test. It was too early and I tested negative. I feel like I’m starting to feel better a few days later, but then Wednesday (8/11/21) I start feeling worse and start producing phlegm and my throat is killing me. I go to the doctor Thursday and I test positive. Oxygen is at 97 and no breathing problems except a little congestion. 

They gave me steroids and an inhaler and sent me home. I take my medicine, start to feel worse, but then start to get better for a day or so. 

Then, I get a lot worse. I feel like it’s getting hard to breathe and continue to cough up phlegm. My throat does start to feel better but looks terrible. My lower abdomen starts to feel really sore especially when I cough. I’m coughing up a little blood. 

Friday, August 20th I go back to the doctor and they do an X-ray. There’s a little inflammation and appears to look like bronchitis. My oxygen is now 95 and breathing is a little more difficult. They give me a zpack (antibiotics) and stronger steroids. They tell me to use my inhaler every four hours (prior it was just as needed). 

The next day I get a little worse. My oxygen is down to 93-94 but I don’t want to go to ER (my little brother was just released from hospital with COVID pneumonia and the only reason they kept him was due to his asthma. He had to go twice before they kept him and his oxygen was lower than mine). Called the oncall doctor at my primary care doctor and they said take one puff on inhaler every 2 hours instead of 2 every 4 hours. Barely sleeping at this point and every cough is agony. 

The next evening my oxygen is dipping to 88 and at 2 am (so technically Monday morning) I decide enough is I’m going to the hospital. I almost pass out on my way to the ER. Once I get there they rush me to an Er room. My oxygen is 77. Two hours later I’m told they’re keeping me, I have pneumonia and I’m in acute respiratory failure. 

My hospital stay was 6 days and they were surprised I survived, much less recovered so quickly. Was on 10 liters of oxygen until last 3 days of my stay. They sent me home on 8/29/21 and I’m still recovering at home with oxygen. Can’t sleep in my own bed because I can’t walk down the stairs. I’m weak as all get out. 

Both my mom and I got covid, though we were both fully vaccinated. Mom caught pneumonia but recovered at home. I’m immunocompromised and almost died. Sam  (little brother) brought covid home and got covid pneumonia and had a week long hospital stay due to asthma (though his covid wasn’t AS bad as mine his oxygen wasn’t great. He didn’t keep his ox on tho. Dummy.)  Isabella his wife had a mild case and my niece just had diarrhea. 

They also spread it to my sister-in-laws parents and both got sick. Her mom recovered but sadly, her stepdad Ron died September 13th after they removed him from his vent for the final time. Neither were vaccinated. 

Samuel is  getting his vaccine as soon as his 3 months are up. Unfortunately, Ron won’t have that opportunity. 💔 

For me, I will be getting the booster and will have to hope my MS doesn’t act up in the four months I have to go without my meds. Be careful y’all with weak immune systems, the vaccine was less effective due to my Rituxan infusion. I’m recovering but I still have a long way to go.

My friend Patrick and I had great fun crafting this social music utility. We hung out in the mountains, went rock climbing, ate pierogis, and brought MusicMatch to life. We hope you enjoy MusicMatch as much as we've enjoyed building it!

348,Political,socialism,Cuba's sucess,"As we all know Cuba under Batista was a capitalist slum, what is often not discussed is just how much Castro and the Cuban revolution improved the material conditions of the average Cuban, which directly opposes the common myth that Cuba is some sort of underdeveloped 3rd world nation.

Pre-revolutionary Cuba was more or less a puppet state for the United States, and as such the workers were subject to horrible conditions whilst also having to witness extreme wealth inequality and there were even higher rates of imperial expropriation. Just before Castro and the communists took power the inequality and expropriation were so bad that 75% of Cuba's total farmlands were owned by foreign investors, 80% of Cuban trade was directly held by the United States. Furthermore, slavery was common place in foreign plantations on the island, and for Cuban worker's where weren't enslaved life wasn't all that much better with a quarter of the population not being able to purchase basic foods.

Once Castro took power this was instantly eradicated through a plethora of progressive actions. For instance, he made massive land redistribution efforts along with mass nationalization of industry (200,000 Cuban peasants were given their own lands) along with eradicating slavery (This lead to conservative Cubans immigrating to the US). These actions instantly caused improvements in the lives of the Cuban workers with the unemployment rate rapidly plummeting from a staggering figure of 25% to what is 1.6% today (2020) which ranks Cuba with the 13th lowest unemployment rate in the entire world.

  
In addition, much of medical assistance was inaccessible to the Cuban working class as an overwhelming majority of medical facility were placed in rich cities mostly run by foreign bourgeoisie. In fact this was so bad that only a single hospital was located rurally on the entire island of Cuba.

This was quickly improved upon post-revolution with healthcare then becoming entirely free, huge expansions to medical facilities and their accessibility, and the government mandating that doctors spend at least one year practising in rural Cuba. This lead to Cuba going from a nation where the average Cuban citizen not being able to see a hospital in miles to Cuba having the highest rate of doctors/physicians in the entire world. This manifested itself through Cuba's life expectancy which is now 77.8 years old which ranks 46th globally and is only 0.6 years behind the richest country known to man. 

Furthermore, the infant mortality rate is currently 4 per 100,000 which sits around the same rate as highly developed economies such as France, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and is even ahead of the United States. This lies in direct contrast to pre-revolutionary Cuba which had an infant mortality rate of 37 per 100,000 which today would place it behind much of the developing world and far below the global average.

All of this becomes extraordinarily impressive considering the embargo limiting Cuba's access to medical supplies. 

This is all not to mention Cuba ensuring the right to education to each and every one of their citizens, which lead to the illiterate masses becoming one of the most literate people on the planet (99.98%), along with the Cuban government increasing the percentage of children enrolled in school in Cuba from 56% to nearly 100% in a few short decades. 

Along with this Cuba massively subsidized housing and eradicated landlords leading to a 0% homeless rate and one of the highest homeownership rates in the world, and subsidizes food for all its citizens.

  
This increase in material conditions can be measured empirically even with bourgeoisie metrics as the HDI (Human Development Index) calculates Cuba to have a ""high"" level of development.

All of this success was done so with strict trading tariffs placed upon the nation, so the question then becomes how well could have Cuba flourished without the embargo. The answer to this lies in the four years where the embargo was temporarily lifted from 2014 to 2017, which saw the Cuban economy grow by approximately 26% in the four years leading to the average annual economic growth being approximately 6.4% good enough to place Cuba as one of the 20 fastest-growing economies on the planet. It should be noted that these GDP figures might actually undervalue the true economic output of Cuba as a result of the international evaluation of the Cuban Peso.

Lastly, I would like to share this amazing little story. Cuba has a centuries-old religion named Santería in which doves often represent Obatalá which means the son of god. When Fidel Castro came to Havanah after securing the revolution he had a speech in which two doves flew over him one of which landed on his shoulder and continued to stay there. As a result of this many Cuban's took this as a sign that Fidel Castro was selected by God to lead Cuba.",None,2021-12-31 5:28:58,0,97,0.93,rstxaa,Undetected

But the party has yet to receive the majority of voices, despite the fact that the party for 20 years has been presenting its candidates for the presidential election.

Also, the party has a reputation of a spoiler that participates only to help Putin's party achieve its goals.

Last week communist leader Mr. Zyuganov has almost let it slip that he's planning to leave the party. This is what he said ""There's a rumor that the elections are going to be full of fraud, but our victory is only achievable through transparent and fair elections, so we all have to unite not to let it happen"".

So either Mr. Zyuganov is facing dementia or he is just tired to play the game. Regardless, communists represent a big part of Russian population, so someone else will fill the void.

#  EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember one of the only ways to counter the Cointelpro we have seen is by being overly nice, so treat all the other apes as if you're dating and you wanna get to first base.

Doing work alone at my desk with poor lighting in my stuffy one bedroom apartment has gotten SO OLD, I just hate doing work at this point, I feel so unmotivated.

Following up with that, I cannot WAIT until I can go to a library where I can feel that sense of camaraderie with other students who are also busting their ass studying or doing work, just like me. I miss that non-verbal sense of connection when you make eye contact with someone in a library & it's like you both say ""yeah man, me too"" but with your eyes. It makes me want to work more when I see other people are working, and having done it all alone this past year SUCKS. Watching other people rewatching lectures or writing essays in the library makes me feel like I'm not the only one having to do this shit.

Also, I cannot WAIT until I can have my normal gym routine back. Going to the gym for me used to always be my form of therapy, a place where the focus was just on what I could accomplish that day & just my general well-being & health. It was a place without distractions or other worries & everything was just set up easily for people to use whether it was like the weight rack or machines, etc. Also there was something so meaningful in seeing the same people at your gym consistently because not only would you see each other progress in the gym, but you'd occasionally make eye contact or give each other a nod like ""good lookin, bro, may all the gains be in your favor"" & it's like I miss that so much. Working out at home SUCKS & I miss that general sense of accountability from others that we used to get when we regularly interacted with people.

Anyway, these are just some of the things that I miss & that I'm really looking forward to in the future, if anyone can relate, let me know please.",None,2021-03-08 16:43:24,0,118,1.0,m0ungi,Undetected

389,Highest raw growth in the last year,askreddit,How do you feel about ’how would you feel?’ posts being banned?,"We’ve gotten a lot of feedback on this one. A lot of feedback. We’ve all seen the “how would you feel about \_\_\_\_” in which the OP is just posting what is considered a ""shower thought"" which is aimed to ask users to support a largely popular concept in a way that fits AskReddit’s rules. Interesting and engaging titles are always great but these posts don’t have much discussion value, which is the purpose of this sub. Because of this, and due to the feedback we’ve received, we’ve decided to remove these posts moving forward.

We do understand that there’s some nuance to this. Some posts are shower thoughts/ideas, and others are actual discussion questions.

For example:

* “*How would you feel about a ’if you accidentally scroll to the top, you can go back to where you were,’ button for Reddit?*” is really just a feature suggestion.
* “*How would you feel about dating someone that makes a lot more money than you?*” is a discussion question.

Our philosophy in AskReddit is to keep rules as objective as possible because it helps ensure fairness and consistency in moderation without allowing for a moderator's personal discretion to interfere in the practice of removing or approving content. However, we also recognize that blanket bans on the phrasing of a question does not always accurately work to meet the spirit of the rules. If you feel your ”How would you feel” post promotes elaborate discussion and is not a rhetorical idea or limiting question, feel free to modmail us a link and we’ll be happy to manually review.

Thank you to the users who modmailed us feedback asking for this policy. We always appreciate constructive feedback and we do take every bit of feedback into consideration. If you or anyone you know has been diagnosed with mesoth...sorry, wrong script...if you have feedback for us, we always appreciate it as we want to give people the best experience in AskReddit.

1/3: In the evening, I feel a slight sore throat. I went for a run in the morning and by evening my legs seem to have given up on me. I go to bed thinking I'll be fine after a night's rest. WRONG. I end up getting the worst body ache (including some of the worst back pain I've ever had) and headache. My head feels like someone's trying to scrape the inside like a coconut. I am unable to sleep except for 2 hours 

1/4: I wake up and the body ache and headache are reduced significantly. I take a rapid test. Positive. Take Tylenol and sleep for a couple of hours during the day. Body ache and headache disappear by the evening

1/5: Have a really bad sore throat. Eating and drinking are fine but the throat just hurts. I was able to do some yoga. In the night woke up to sweats. 

1/6: Throat ache is gone. Headache is somewhat back but a lot milder. I was able to do some yoga again. Take the test again. Still positive. 

1/7: Headache is almost gone. Did more yoga. 

1/8: No symptoms so decide to take the test. Really faint line 

1/9: No symptoms, no line on the test. I decide to end my isolation. 


So my worst day was the first day when I couldn't sleep and had a bad body ache and headache. At no point did I get cough or breathlessness. No gastrointestinal symptoms, no loss of smell and taste. Appetite was normal. 

My Omicron bout was truly mild though I know not all people seem to be this lucky. The vaccine definitely helped. What also helped is salt water gargles and consuming lots of water.

415,Political,PoliticalDiscussion,What and when should candidates have to tell the public about their health?,"This morning, [Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) announced that she had been diagnosed with and successfully treated for early stage breast cancer](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/09/klobuchar-breast-cancer-treatment-510822) between February and May. This information remained private for many months.

In March, [Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) announced that he would undergo surgery for prostate cancer.](https://apnews.com/article/charlotte-north-carolina-thom-tillis-665689ef47d318067b75c7888cb7adb5) He was diagnosed just days before the 2020 election, which featured his very close race against Cal Cunningham in what could have been a swing state and and Senate flipping race. Again, his diagnosis was not made public until several months later.

I wish them both well in their recoveries.

I am curious though about how politicians and candidates are expected to balance their rights to medical privacy against the public's interest in whether they believe a candidate is fit for the job. This was a major plot point on the West Wing when the President revealed that he had concealed his neurological disorder from the public before he was elected, which inevitably called his fitness for the office into question and loomed over the remainder of his presidency.

When, if ever, should candidates have to disclose their health diagnoses? Is it alright for them to withhold information? Does the disease matter? Can politicians not on a ballot keep matters private longer, such as Sen. Klobuchar's situation? Can politicians who receive a major diagnosis just before an election withhold that information from the electorate as in Sen. Tillis' situation?

Another report I read earlier mentioned that Youtube has paid over $30B to creators over the last 2-3 years (all those annoying unskippable ads doing some good perhaps).

One edge that Youtube has is that they don't have to pay creators upfront like Netflix does. They only share revenue upon monetization. It makes them a very cashflow friendly business that's growing 35-40%. [Their direct response ads business is also going gangbusters.](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/a-new-youtube-feature-will-make-its-connected-tv-ads-more-shoppable/)

436,Covid related,COVID19positive,Mom has covid-pneumonia.,"This was the progression for my mother (f-50) and I hope this can help others. She was not vaccinated due to propaganda + stubbornness. I might have missed some days/symptoms. All the days blend together when you wake up every single night, multiple times, to care for your loved ones. 

Day 0: She made contact with a covid positive friend

Day 3: She starts experiencing fever, chills, and sweating. We thought it was a cold, but I had a deep gut feeling that it was COVID.

Day 5: I dropped off Tylenol and Dayquil in the morning. She started having the worst body aches she experienced. Her smell was gone. I bought a oxygen saturation sensor off of Amazon. 

Day 7: My mom lives by herself so I decided to quarantine with her and take care of her while she was getting over this disease. I got her some Musinex as well as the tylenol and dayquil. She started coughing phlegm as well. Her oxygen saturation was in the low 90's, sometimes going to 88.

Day 8: Around noon, I saw that her oxygen level was in the low-mid 80's and took her to the emergency room. It took about 8 hours for her to get a room. She was CT-scanned and had covid induced pneumonia (round glass apperance). No visitation was allowed. She received monochlonal antibodies, steroids, and 2L of oxygen. I know most people get these and feel fine but there was no change with my moms status (maybe internally, but she didn't feel any relief that most people talk about). 

Day 9: She is now in the hospital with 2L of oxygen with all the steroid treatments (Remdesivir). She has COVID pneumonia in both lungs with a lot of inflammation. Her fever went away. She still coughs a lot. If her oxygen level is stable, they will send her home with oxygen. 

Day 11: She is on 3L of oxygen and maintaining 93% saturation. She is having a difficult time breathing.

Day 12: She is discharged with 2L of oxygen. She feels okay. She eats solid food and generally looks like she had a bad flu.

Day 13: She is on 2L of oxygen with dexamethasone. The healthcare provider recommend hospitalization if her oxygen level falls below 91. She still eats fine.

Day 14: She is stable'ish. Very uncomfortable feeling in the chest. Lots of coughing and is in the prone position most of the day. Seemed clear she was declining again.

Day 15: In the morning her oxygen level was in the 88 to 93. It fluctuated a lot and that was the most frustrating part of using the saturation level as a baseline for going to the hospital. Mom didn't want to go back, she was scared and thought it would get better. DO NOT LISTEN IF THEY ARE RELUCTANT TO GO. I bumped up the oxygen to 3L (Per recommendation by healthcare professional) and went to sleep.

Day 16: I woke up to her on the ground in pain. She couldn't breathe. Her oxygen level was 86 with 3L. I took her to the hospital right away. She immediately went into ICU. She received highflow oxygen at 50L at 50%. High flow is so loud and uncomfortable for her. She hated it but she could breathe.  Now in the ICU, when she was first brought in, the doctor immediately asked me if they could ventilate her because her oxygen saturation was in the 80's with a high respiratory rate. As he was discussing this with me, her oxygen went back up. Her oxygen level was at 96% now. They let me stay in the ICU, I think they thought it would be any moment for her to be ventilated. She tests negative for COVID.

Day 17: She is struggling to breathe. The ICU is loud with her monitor constantly going when her oxygen level falls to 88 or lower. Her breathing rate is high. She is still on 50L at 50% oxygen. The doctor comes in again and tells me they will ventilate her. As they prepare, mom stabilizes again. Doctor doesn't want to ventilate her if she is stable so we wait again.

Day 18: At 1 AM she is having trouble breathing, rapid breaths, low oxygen level (86-90). She is dead tired, she looked half dead. Doctor tells me to prepare for her to be ventilated. I call my family. Mom stabilizes again. Oxygen level goes back up to low 90s. Her blood pressure is low.

Day 19: She got better. Was put on 4L of oxygen around noon. She still has a lot of pain in her diaphragm from coughing so much. She has trouble sleeping at night from pain. Her blood pressure is low.

Day 20: She is out of the ICU and into a regular room. She is on 2L of oxygen with oxygen saturation of 96-99. She has trouble sleeping at night. She has chest pains. She is placed in IMU (not sure what it stands for). She is placed back on high flow during 2 or 3 AM at 50% at 50L. Her blood pressure is low.

Day 21: She finally gets a room in IMU. Doctors do a CT scan/Xray at 6 AM. It shows her lungs improving (a tiny tiny bit). She calms down and her vitals go back to normal. Oxygen with highflow is at 97%. She can't sleep.

Day 22: Her high flow in the morning is turned down to 40% at 30L. She is still maintaining 93 to 96%. She will be off of high flow again soon. Doctor says yesterday might be the peak of this disease. She seems lively-ier. Doctor mentions that every single COVID positive ICU patient he had since June of this year was unvaccinated. 

Day 27: she is doing so much better. She still has shortness of breath when doing activities but overall I think she’s going to be perfectly okay. She had some issues with very low blood pressure but that came from her tapering off of the steroids (according to the doctor).

469,Highest raw growth in the last year,stocks,How is DoorDash a 62 billion company?,"I am interested in hearing a bull case for doordash. I've seen many youtube videos, reddit posts, articles on why this stock is overvalued at 18 price to sales ratio which implies at least 20-25% sales growth (sales growth 6-9x) for the next 10 years based on my model. Even Uber, which I consider to be massively overvalued, (because of its unprofitable low margin,no moat, slowing growth business) is trading only 17 billion marketcap more for postmates, uber eats and most dominant ride haling service.(63 vs 80 bil)

With earnings miss, i would thought that this stock would go down, but doordash ended the day up 3.5% while airbnb is barely up on better earnings. Even Disney stock, which crushed earnings, is only up 1%, and trades at a more reasonable valuation. In my opinion, you cant miss earnings, and expect to go up, yet DoorDash did and the guidance wasnt that great either.

So why did doordash go up today on earnings? I didn't see any reddit post on doordash earnings, in fact I rarely hear anyone talk about this stock which is surprising considering its a 62 billion growth company. ( i hear more people discuss corsair which is a 2 billion company) Yet, despite the earnings miss, analysts kept upgrading the price targets for this stock today yet they never explain why they upgraded doordash.

I would like to hear your thoughts on why this stock is worth the price, I always like to hear bull cases, on companies I find overvalued (i enjoy reading opinions on crowdstrike, nvidia, moderna so even thought I find those stocks are overvalued I understand the market valuation is so high on those companies.) Alot of stocks that I believe to have positive sentiment isn't really moving higher, like sofi, disney, shift, alibaba, amazon while stocks that I see have more negative sentiment on youtube/reddit like doordash, carvana, zoom are performing relatively better? (Even Nikola is still worth 4-5 billion somehow)

In short, I am interested in hearing a bull case for doordash and why doordash went up on earnings while most stocks went down on earnings (like sofi, ttcf, which is consider to be reasonable valuation but fell 15%)",None,2021-08-13 9:46:31,0,1498,0.97,p3ozbg,Undetected

486,Political,Libertarian,"Libertarians, I think it is time to have this conversation: there are many schools of thought within Libertarianism and there are left wing libertarians just like there are right wing libertarians. There are liberal libertarians and conservative libertarians. And much more.","Lately I have been seeing a LOT of people here who believe libertarianism to be exclusively a right-wing philosophy and quickly attempt to discard the idea that Libertarians could have other political stances more to the left. 

The truth is that Libertarianism is not a solid block ideology but rather an ideological tree with many branches, it's basic trunk probably being the principles of anti-authoritarianism and personal freedoms and liberties, and if I may, not the liberty to do whatever you want but to do whatever is right by you and society. 

I say this too because I have seen lots of people here believe that total libertarianism can, for example, allow a business to discriminate or refuse service to a customer based on ANY reasons they might have. But discrimination on ANY grounds (such as race or sex) is not libertarianism. It is plain bigotry and might be illegal in some jurisdictions.

I understand that in the US, libertarianism as a political philosophy is mostly based on the right wing variant of it and Reddit has a large US userbase, so it is natural to see more right-wing libertarians here but we have to keep in mind that there are also anti-authoritarian left-wing libertarians whom might be in favor of social welfare and equality while at the same time advocating for personal liberties. There's all flavors of libertarianism and that's a good thing. It nurtures the discussion and ideas.

Here's a simple chart to help visualize the Libertarian universe and the many schools of thought within it:

China Evergrande, the troubled property giant, made interest payments on at least two of its bonds on Wednesday, a company bondholder said, a sign that it yet again managed to head off default.

Evergrande owed investors interest payments totaling nearly $150 million on three bonds, with the grace periods for those payments set to expire on Wednesday. Missing them would have triggered a default that could ripple through the Chinese economy: With some $300 billion in debt outstanding, the company’s inability to pay its debt would potentially hurt banks, property developers, and even home buyers in the country.

Instead, the company has managed to leap from one deadline to the next, meeting its obligations at the last minute — but often without explaining how or even publicly disclosing that it had done so. The company has tried to sell off parts of its empire to raise enough cash.

In October, when Evergrande said it had scrapped its effort to sell a $2.6 billion stake in its property services company to another developer, the company warned in a Hong Kong securities filing that there was “no guarantee” it would be able to meet its financial obligations or negotiate an extension with its creditors.

On Wednesday, the company met its interest payment deadline for bonds that mature in 2022 and 2023, the company bondholder said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter.

The person did not specify if a payment on the third bond had also been made, but Bloomberg News reported that obligations for all three bonds were met, citing a spokesman for a clearing house.

The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Although Evergrande has managed to avoid default so far, its troubles have already begun to weigh on other Chinese developers, with the government tightening controls on borrowing and investors retreating from the sector.

At least six Chinese property developers have defaulted on foreign bonds in recent weeks, rattling domestic financial markets and raising the cost of borrowing for all Chinese companies. Property prices are slowing and fewer people are buying apartments, worsening the outlook for real estate.

Evergrande’s challenges could spread outside of China as well, as they ripple through global financial markets. On Monday, the Federal Reserve said troubles in China’s property sector could threaten the United States.

“Given the size of China’s economy and financial system as well as its extensive trade linkages with the rest of the world, financial stresses in China could strain global financial markets through a deterioration of risk sentiment, pose risks to global economic growth, and affect the United States,” the Fed said in its twice-yearly update on the American financial system.",None,2021-11-10 14:40:11,0,540,0.84,qr68n0,Undetected

They also pretend to show compassion to the immigrants by talking about all the dead bodies of immigrants that are found in the desert in Texas. They say that's why we need more government. No, that's why we need less government. It's the government regulations and restrictions that make immigrants go through the desert and through private property. If we had a free immigration policy like we used to have then they would just come in through our ports of entry. They also say ""we can't have free immigration because terrorists will come in"". Another problem created by the government, why do terrorists exist and hate America? Because of our governments fucked up foreign policy. They create all these problems and then use them as an excuse to take more of our liberty and create even more problems.
